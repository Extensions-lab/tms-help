# Google MAPs Integration

TMS utilizes the Google Maps service for access to mapping services for geocoding addresses, route planning, and determining distances and transport durations.

Companies using TMS must have their own Google account with activated Google Maps services, which will be used by TMS.

Google Maps is a paid service.

To enable Google Maps in TMS, it is necessary to enter the Google API Key in the Assisted Setup window of the TMS module.
