# Transportation Management System (TMS) - Buy Licenses

Purchase and assign licenses. Immediately after installation, TMS is not available to users and is not visible in the Business Central menu, therefore, it is necessary to purchase TMS licenses. This can be done from the TMS page on AppSource by selecting the pricing plan that best suits your company. Then, assign licenses to users who will work with TMS in the Microsoft 365 Admin Center.

p.s. It is not mandatory to buy as many licenses as Business Central licenses; you can limit it to only those who work with transportation and TMS.

Licenses are purchased directly on the TMS page on the AppSource portal. Click "Buy now" button.
