# Shipper Scenario

if you are a Shipper company that manages the transportation process of its sales (and purchase) orders and uses either its own transport with its drivers or hires, as well as uses third-party carriers.

The shipper scenario involves three documents:

- **Transport Request**: is a transportation request based on internal company documents, such as purchase orders, sales orders, or transfer orders. It defines WHAT needs to be transported, where the goods are to be picked up, and where they need to be delivered, while also specifying the shipper and the consignee [details](transportrequest.md).
- **Logistic Units**: is an item of any composition intended for transportation. Logistic units take many forms: a single box containing a limited number of products, a pallet with multiple products, or an intermodal container containing multiple pallets.
- **Delivery Order**: is a document that details HOW the transportation will be carried out. It specifies the carrier, driver, and vehicle. The Delivery Order represents the actual journey of the truck, outlining the stops where loading or unloading will take place.
