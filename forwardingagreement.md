# Forwarding Agreement

The Forwarding Agreement (FWA) entity in this Transportation Management System represents a contractual arrangement between the company and customers for transportation services, defining the terms, pricing, and billing structure for transport operations.

It consists of two main components: the Forwarding Agreement Type (template) that defines the structure and pricing model, and the Forwarding Agreement (instance) that represents the actual contract with a specific customer.

The agreement includes essential details such as customer information, contract validity dates, currency, incoterms, and pricing lines for various services, while the type template automatically populates agreement lines with predefined services, quantities, and prices when a new agreement is created.

This system enables standardized contract management by allowing companies to create reusable agreement templates that can be applied to multiple customers, ensuring consistent pricing and service delivery across different forwarding agreements while maintaining detailed tracking of contract terms, billing arrangements, and customer-specific transportation requirements.
