# Statuses

The status system is a core tool for managing and controlling transportation processes. It defines the set of steps a transportation request goes through within a company—from initial request approval, document preparation, coordination, approval, profit calculation, to cost collection from third-party providers (such as carriers), and more. These are not statuses of the physical movement of goods, but rather statuses of the overall process—from request to final invoicing.

The list of statuses, along with the rules defining what actions are allowed or restricted at each stage for a specific type of Forwarding Order, is called a status profile.

A status profile is a structured set of statuses that a forwarding and transportation order goes through during its lifecycle within the business process. This profile determines which operations are permitted and what restrictions apply to the document in each specific status.

Such a configuration ensures systematic progress and control over the document's state within the workflow.

## How TMS uses the status system

The status system is utilized for document types such as Forwarding Orders and Freight Orders. Different types of documents may have diverse status structures, allowing for more flexible configuration of the document processing business process.

- "Action Control System" parameter allows for the authorization or prohibition of actions that can be performed with documents having a selected status. This facilitates the organization of workflow and the orderly processing of documents, as well as synchronizing the efforts of individuals working simultaneously on the same document. Works only for Forwarding Orders.

You can activate verification by setting a flag in the field of the corresponding column. Determine whether an order can be posted, whether an invoice can be issued, and whether copying or modifying a document with the given status is allowed.

## Extended Control for Statuses

Extended Control for a status allows you to enhance the requirements for transitioning to that status. It enables the creation of a document control system (attachments) that must be present in the transportation process for the order to move to the selected status.

To activate this control, you can define the types of attachments that must be uploaded to the document—for example, before it can be posted. In other words, you set rules requiring that, at a certain status, specific documents (such as MAWB, Invoice, Delivery Note, etc.) must be attached in the system [details](attachmentcontrol.md).

## Additional

To ensure the action control system functions, it must be activated globally in the TMS Setup page.
