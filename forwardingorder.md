# Forwarding Order

The Forwarding Order represents the central document in the Transportation Management System (TMS) extension for Business Central, specifically designed for Logistics Service Provider (LSP) scenarios. It serves as a comprehensive transportation request that orchestrates the movement of goods from origin to destination, managing the entire logistics workflow from initial request through final delivery and settlement.

## Core Structure and Components

The Forwarding Order consists of several interconnected entities that work together to provide complete transportation management:

- General (Forwarding Order Header) - The main document containing essential information such as unique order number, document type, posting date, and comprehensive party details including ordering party, shipper, and consignee information. It manages document-level attributes like status codes, stage profiles, dates (requested/planned/actual pickup and delivery), and includes extensive address information for both loading and unloading locations with full contact details, phone numbers, email addresses, and GLN identifiers.
- Content (Forwarding Order Line) - Detailed line items specifying the cargo being transported, supporting multiple types including Items, [Products](product.md), Unit Types, and actual (Logistic Units). Each line contains comprehensive physical characteristics including quantities, dimensions (length, width, height), weights (gross, net, chargeable), volumes, freight classifications, and GTIN identifiers. The system automatically calculates volumetric weights and chargeable weights based on configurable multipliers.
- Settlement ([Forwarding Order Settlement](settlement.md)) - Financial settlement lines that manage both income (services provided to customers) and costs (charges incurred from vendors/carriers). These lines support multi-currency transactions with automatic exchange rate calculations, link to Business Central sales and purchase documents, and maintain comprehensive audit trails with posting dates and document references.
- Stages - Transportation stages that break down the journey into manageable segments, each potentially assigned to different freight orders - carriers, enabling complex multi-modal transportation scenarios.

## Key Features and Capabilities

The Forwarding Order provides sophisticated functionality including:

- status management with configurable [status profiles](statuses.md) controlling document workflow
- stage management through [stage profiles](stages.md) that define transportation segments
- logistic unit integration for cargo consolidation and tracking
- freight order assignment for carrier management [about freight orders](freightorder.md)
- settlement management with automatic invoice and credit memo generation [details](settlement.md)
- map integration for route visualization and location management [details](googlemapintegration.md)
- document generation with confirmation and invoice printing capabilities
- transport documents control system [details](attachmentcontrol.md)
- AI-powered assistance through Copilot integration for automated order creation
- track, and monitor completion of operational tasks [details](checklist.md)

## Business Process Integration

The Forwarding Order seamlessly integrates with Business Central's core functionality, automatically generating sales invoices and purchase documents, maintaining currency conversion with exchange rate management, supporting multi-company scenarios, providing extensive reporting capabilities, and offering flexible customization through configurable order types that define default behaviors, allowed services, and workflow rules.
This system enables logistics service providers to efficiently manage complex transportation operations while maintaining full integration with standard Business Central financial and operational processes, providing a complete solution for modern transportation management needs.
