# Settlement Process

## Overview

The Settlement process in the Transportation Management System (TMS) is a comprehensive financial management feature that handles the complete lifecycle of Forwarding Order finances. It serves as the central hub for managing income, costs, billing, and financial reconciliation for transportation services.

Settlement is a comprehensive financial review and closure process that ensures all monetary aspects of a transportation order are accounted for, from the initial calculation of charges to the final payment and invoicing, ensuring transparency and financial integrity.

## What is Settlement?

Settlement in TMS is the process of **determining, recording, and reconciling all financial aspects** : of a forwarding order. It encompasses:

- **Income Calculation** : Identifying and calculating all charges to be billed to customers. This involves determining the total amount that will be billed to the client for the transportation services provided, including freight charges, fuel surcharges, and any other additional services rendered during the transportation process.
- **Cost Management** : Tracking and allocating all expenses incurred during transportation. This includes accounting for all expenses incurred by the company in providing these services, such as payments made to third-party service providers, carriers, fuel costs, and any other operational expenses linked to this forwarding order.
- **Financial Reconciliation** : Ensuring accurate recording of all monetary transactions. The settlement process ensures that all income and expenses are accurately recorded, reconciled, and the net amount (profit or loss) is determined. This step is crucial for financial reporting, budgeting, and financial management within the company.
- **Document Generation** : Creating invoices, credit memos, and purchase documents. As part of the settlement, invoices are generated for clients based on the determined charges, and payments are processed for any third-party services utilized during the transportation process.
- **Profit Analysis** : Calculating net profit or loss for each Forwarding Order.

## Key Components

### 1. Settlement Lines

Each settlement consists of multiple settlement lines, where each line represents either:

- **Income** : Services provided to customers (positive amounts)
- **Cost** : Expenses paid to vendors/suppliers (negative amounts)

#### Settlement Line Structure

- **Type** : Income or Cost
- **Code** : [Service](services.md) or [Charge](charges.md) code from master data
- **Description** : Human-readable description
- **Quantity** : Number of units (services)
- **Unit of Measure** : How the service/charge is measured
- **Price** : Unit price
- **Amount** : Total line amount
- **Currency** : Transaction currency
- **Customer/Vendor** : Associated business partner
- **Amount (ACY)** : Will be calculated automatically

### 2. Master Data Integration

#### Services (Income Lines)

Services define what you charge customers for:

- **Code** : Unique service identifier
- **Description** : Service description
- **Unit of Measure** : How the service is billed
- **Invoice Line Type** : Maps to Business Central entities (G/L Account, Item, Resource, etc.)
- **Invoice Line No.** : Specific Business Central record

#### Charges (Cost Lines)

Charges define what you pay suppliers for:

- **Code** : Unique charge identifier
- **Description** : Charge description
- **Unit of Measure** : How the charge is measured
- **Purchase Line Type** : Maps to Business Central purchase entities
- **Purchase Line No.** : Specific Business Central record
- **Default Vendor** : Default supplier for this charge

## Settlement Process Workflow

### Initial Setup

1. **Create Forwarding Order Type** : Forwarding order template
2. **Define Services** : Configure what services will be provided [details](services.md)
3. **Set Up Charges** : Define expected costs and suppliers [details](charges.md)

### Settlement Line Creation

#### Manual Entry

- Add settlement lines directly in the settlement subform
- Select appropriate Service or Charge codes
- Enter quantities, prices, and amounts
- Specify customer/vendor information

#### Automated Calculation

- **Distance-based** : Automatically calculate quantities based on transportation distance
- **Weight-based** : Calculate quantities based on cargo weight
- **Price List Integration** : Apply predefined pricing rules

### Cost Allocation

Link settlement cost lines to actual purchase documents:

- **Purchase Invoice Lines** : Allocate costs from purchase invoices
- **Posted Purchase Invoice Lines** : Link to already posted purchase invoices
- **Purchase Credit Memo Lines** : Handle cost corrections and refunds

### Document Generation

#### Sales Documents (Income)

- **Create Invoice** : Generate sales invoices for customers
- **Create Credit Memo** : Handle customer refunds and corrections
- **Add to Sales Invoice** : Add settlement lines to existing sales documents
- **Sync Income Lines** : Synchronize settlement changes with sales documents

#### Purchase Documents (Cost)

- **Create Purchase Invoice** : Generate purchase invoices for suppliers. The function is used when we issue a purchase invoice to ourselves on behalf of the carrier — i.e., the carrier is unable to issue the invoice, so we do it for them.
Normally, the carrier sends us an invoice, for example as a PDF, and we enter it into Business Central as a Purchase Invoice, then upload it to the Settlement of the corresponding Forwarding Order. In this case, however, the process is different: we create a Cost line in the Settlement and then generate a purchase invoice from there.
- **Link Purchase Lines** : Connect settlement lines to purchase documents

### Financial Reconciliation
