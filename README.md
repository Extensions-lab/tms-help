# Transportation Management System for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central

## Introduction

TMS is a comprehensive solution intended to streamline the transportation processes, including order management, scheduling, and tracking of shipments.

The TMS solution is ideal for two usage scenarios:

- if you are a Shipper company that manages the transportation process of its sales, purchase and trasnfer orders and uses either its own transport with its drivers or hires, as well as uses third-party carriers.
- if you are a Logistic Service Provider (LSP) whose business involves the delivery of third-party goods, managing the transportation process and may also have its own fleet of vehicles and drivers or utilize services of third-party carriers. In this scenario, the mechanism for cost control and transparency in the invoicing process for transportation is crucial.
