# Delivery Order

is a document that details HOW the transportation will be carried out. It specifies the carrier, driver, and vehicle. The Delivery Order represents the actual journey of the truck, outlining the stops where loading or unloading will take place.

## Capabilities

The Delivery Order document covers the following functional areas of the TMS:

- Load Management
- Route Management
- Weight, Volume, Footage Control
- Load Sequencing & Optimization

A Delivery Order is:

- a real vehicle run, the actual driving route, detailing the order of stops the vehicle must make
- a set of tasks to be completed, such as loading, unloading, or pallet pickup,
- a loading sequence for the truck,
- a tool for control weight, volume, or footage limits at each stop along the route

Delivery Order consolidates multiple transport requests into a single document, creating a vehicle route that accounts for weight and volume constraints, while optimizing the route based on distance or duration.
