# Driver

The Driver entity is a comprehensive master data table in the Transportation Management System (TMS) that manages complete driver profiles for transportation operations.
It contains extensive driver information including:

- personal details (names, birth date, employment date)
- contact information (phone numbers, email, emergency contacts)
- professional qualifications (license details, categories, expiration dates), compliance certifications (medical cards, ADR for dangerous goods), - operational settings (carrier association, default vehicle assignment, fuel card, scheduler preferences).

The entity supports mobile integration through Proof of Delivery (PoD) app credentials and includes photo management capabilities with camera integration. It features a comprehensive card page with organized sections for all driver data, a list page for browsing and selection, and a dedicated picture management page part.

The Driver entity serves as the central repository for driver-related information, enabling effective driver assignment, scheduling, compliance tracking, and operational management within the TMS while ensuring regulatory compliance and supporting mobile workforce operations.

This directory allows you to store information not only about your own drivers but also to register drivers from third-party carriers if needed.
