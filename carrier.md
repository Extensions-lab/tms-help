# Carrier

The Carrier entity is a comprehensive master data table in the Transportation Management System (TMS) that manages transportation service providers and their operational configurations.
It contains extensive carrier information including:

- basic identification (carrier number, primary and secondary names)
- Business Central integration (source type linking to vendors, resources, employees, or shipping agents with automatic name population)
- operational settings (freight agreement numbers, mode of transport, truckload shipping type, blocking status)
- default resource assignments (default vehicle, driver, and unit type with automatic name lookups)
- internet resources (website and tracking URLs)
- scheduling preferences (sort order and blocking controls)
- performance metrics (calculated fields for total distance, route quantity, and freight order counts).

The entity supports flexible integration with existing Business Central entities through an extensible source type enum, includes photo management capabilities, and features comprehensive card and list pages with navigation to related drivers, vehicles, and freight agreements.

The Carrier entity serves as the central hub for transportation service provider management within the TMS, enabling effective carrier selection, default resource assignment, performance tracking, and operational planning while supporting seamless integration with existing Business Central master data and providing detailed operational metrics for carrier evaluation and management.
